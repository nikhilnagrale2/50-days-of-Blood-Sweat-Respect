# Nth root of an integer

## Bruteforce

- as we know that the nth root of an integer is between 1 and n.
- so we can apply binary search on answer to find the nth root of an integer.
- for a particular value we will check if the nth power of the value is M or not.
- if it is M then we will return the value.
